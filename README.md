# Responsive Portfolio Summary

A Responsive design is essential to any web development project. Web Apps need to "look good" on all screen sizes (i.g., monitor, tablet, iPhone, etc). This repo provides a general template for anyone interested in building their own portfolio site. The text, headers, and links can all be updated to meet your specific needs.

## Directions

Three pages.

1. Index

   - This page allows you to add a profile image and description about yourself. Update the image url and text within the <p> tag to customize your site.

2. Portfolio

   - The portfolio is where you can update each card with your own skills/experience. Each card includes a url link that you can update. For example, I currently, have my "LinkedIn" card linked to my LinkedIn profile page. Please note, that the link will open up in your current browser.

3. Contact Me

   - This page provides the form for viewers to contact you. This can be updated to send emails directly to your personal email.

4. All Pages
   - All pages include a navbar and footer. The navbar/footer can be updated as needed.
   - All pages are also responsive and built in with breakpoints. The breakpoints used are 640px, 768px, and 980px (width). See image below for layout difference at 680px vs 768px.
