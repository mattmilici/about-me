# Responsive Portfolio Summary

A Responsive design is essential to any web development project. Web Apps need to "look good" on all screens size (i.g., monitor, tablet, iPhone, etc). This repo provides a general template for any interested in building their own portfolio site. The text, headers, and links can all be updated.

## Directions

Three pages.

1. Index

   - This page allows you to add a profile image and description about you and your work. Update the image url and text within the <p> tag to customize your site.

2. Portfolio

   - The portfolio is where you can update each card with your own skills/experience. Each card includes a url link that you can update. For example, I currently, have my "LinkedIn" card linked to my LinkedIn profile page.

3. Contact Me

   - This page provides the form for viewers to contact you. This can be updated to send emails directly to your personal email.

4. All Pages
   - All pages include a navbar and footer. The navbar can be updated as needed.
